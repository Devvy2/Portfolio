  "Description": "My name is Joakim Sørenes, and I'm a Frontend Developer based in Haugesund. Over the past six months, I've completed the theoretical part of a one-year intensive frontend-focused course, following the bootcamp model. During this time, I've gained extensive knowledge of programming languages and tools, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Git/Github and figma. Additionally, I've finished the elective backend module of the course, providing me with fullstack knowledge, focusing on Node/Express, SQL and MongoDB.\n\nWhen I'm not busy coding, I enjoy spending time with friends, either exploring the city or working on cars.\n\nDo you have a Project in mind for me? Feel free to contact me, and let's make something great together.",
