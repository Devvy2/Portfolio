          My name is Joakim SÃ¸renes, I&apos;m a frontend developer based in
          Haugesund.
          <br />
          Over the course called Kodehode the last 6 months, I&apos;ve gained
          skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and figma. <br /> Which I find
          extremely fun and interesting. <br /> <br />
          I&apos;m passionate about music and new technology, how it works and
          how to optimize it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Got a project in mind for me? contact me and let&apos;s make something
          great.
